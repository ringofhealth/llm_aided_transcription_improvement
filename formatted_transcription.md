# The Cycle of Fourths and Fifths

What is the cycle of fourths and fifths, and why is it so important for us as guitar players? Let's explore this concept.

## Importance of Theory

I’m going to be honest: when I started playing guitar, my primary goal was to play chords and solos—essentially, to play cool stuff. While that’s a great aspiration, I initially resisted learning music theory, which I now realize was a significant oversight.

### Analogy for Understanding

To illustrate the importance of theory, imagine an alien arrives in my room, trying to find a way out. The alien is confused because the closet, wall, door, and window all look similar, each with different handles. They don't even recognize that what they see is a handle. In this scenario, understanding the theoretical information about identifying the door becomes crucial for finding a way out.

# The Mistake

That was a **big mistake**. The reason I say it’s a mistake is that, imagine an alien enters my room. They are trying to get out, but they don’t know where the door is. The closet, wall, door, and window all look very similar, each with different handles. They don’t even realize that it’s a handle.

## Theoretical Information

Understanding what the door is can lead them to a completely different realm of **sound**. These elements are often utilized in movies to convey certain emotions or situations. It’s almost a strange phenomenon.

### Recognition of Sound

You might recognize this sound because:
- The two centers are far apart
- There is that music that we...

# Understanding Sound and Its Impact

Sound can transport us to different spaces. This phenomenon is often utilized in movies to convey specific emotions or themes. The recognition of certain sounds can evoke a sense of *strangeness*, especially when the two sound sources are distant from one another. The music we experience articulates this feeling of distance, enhancing the overall emotional impact.

## The Geographical Shifts of Music

Music often shifts between geographical points, resembling coordinates that create the sensation of being in a different location.

# The Sense of Wonder in Music

I know that a feeling is being created—one that articulates a sense of *wonder*. It feels strange in a way. If you're enjoying this video and finding value in it, please click the like button, subscribe, and consider turning on notifications. Thank you!

## Musical Coordinates

Music can be likened to shifting between geographical points, almost like navigating through coordinates.

- Being in a **C major scale** feels like *home base*.
- Visiting a friend in **China** feels like being in **A flat**, which is quite distant from my home.
- Saying hi to my mom in **New York** places me in **F major**, representing my body in Queens.

While my mom actually lives in **Israel**, I should have used that as an example. Regardless, the concept remains: it’s all about understanding these musical coordinates.

# Understanding the C Major Scale

The C major scale serves as a **home base**. For instance, when I think about visiting my friend in China, it might represent **A flat**; that's quite a distance from me. Then, I could say hello to my mom in New York, which would symbolize **F major**, reflecting my roots in Queens. However, it's worth noting that my mom actually lives in **Israel**, so that should have been my example instead.

## The Importance of Understanding Context

Understanding the context of how we transition from point A to point B is crucial. We need to consider the devices we can utilize for this journey. If we grasp the logic—not just the sequence of flats and sharps, which is interesting and will be covered later—but also the underlying principles, then we’ll be in a strong position.

## Exploring Diagrams

Many of you have likely encountered these types of diagrams; they are useful tools. While there’s nothing wrong with them, I want to explore the concepts in greater depth.

# Understanding the Transition from Point A to Point B

The situation involves understanding how we're moving from **point A to point B** and identifying the devices we can utilize to achieve that transition. If we grasp not only the sequence of flat and sharp notes—an interesting topic that we'll cover—but also the underlying logic, we'll be well-prepared to proceed.

## Importance of Sound

Many of you have probably encountered these types of diagrams; they are valuable and very helpful. However, I want to emphasize the importance of understanding the **sound** we are discussing.

## The Cycles

We often reference **two cycles** in music theory:
- The cycle of fourths
- The cycle of fifths

### Cycle of Fourths

What does the cycle of fourths mean? A fourth consists of **four notes**. For example, in the key of C major, the notes are **C, D, E,** and **F**. Notably, the guitar is tuned in this manner, making the cycle of fourths a significant aspect of guitar playing.

# Understanding the Sound: Cycles of Fourths and Fifths

To understand the sound we're discussing, we first need to address two fundamental cycles: **the cycle of fourths** and **the cycle of fifths**.

## The Cycle of Fourths

The cycle of fourths is a sequence of notes that can be outlined as follows:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four

For example, in the key of **C major**, the notes involved are **C, D, E,** and **F**. The guitar is tuned in a way that aligns with this fourth system, making it a significant aspect of the instrument. The open strings **E, A, D,** and **G** represent fourths. Notably, between **G** and **B**, we encounter a major third. Overall, fourths play a crucial role in shaping the sound of the guitar.

## The Cycle of Fifths

Next, we turn our attention to the cycle of fifths. The fifth consists of five notes, which can be listed as follows:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five

In the key of **C major**, the notes in this cycle are **C, D, E, F,** and **G**. This visual cue is integral to how we navigate the guitar, as it is a constant presence in our playing.

By understanding both the cycle of fourths and the cycle of fifths, we can better appreciate the harmonic structure and sound of the guitar.

# Open Strings and Intervals

The open strings on the guitar are **E**, **A**, **D**, and **G**. These notes are all a fourth apart. Between **G** and **B**, we find a **major third**, followed by another **fourth**. The fourth is a significant aspect of the sound of this instrument.

## Identifying the Fifth

Next, let's identify the fifth. 

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five—**C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G**.

This sequence serves as a visual cue for how we play on the guitar.

## C Major Scale

I am using the **C major scale** as my template, specifically the **Ionian C major scale**. The notes of this scale are **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G**, **A**, **B**, **C**. I will transpose this sound to the next key, which will be a fourth up.

### How to Identify the Next Key

Now, how do I determine what the next key is?

# C Major Scale as a Template

This is the **Ionian C Major Scale**:  
*C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C*

## Copying the Sound

Next, I will copy and paste that sound into the next key, which is a **fourth up**.

### Determining a Fourth Up

- How do I determine what a fourth up is? We just discussed this concept.
- I will start from the note **F**.

### The Change in Sound

By following this pattern, I arrive at **B flat**. This is a significant change because it involves one, two, three, four **whole tones** or whole steps.

As a result, I am achieving the same sound of the **F Major Scale**, starting from the note **F**.

# Introduction
We just discussed the topic, and now I’m going to start from the note **F**. That’s my **B flat**, which marks a significant change because we are moving up a fourth.

# Understanding the Scale
Counting one, two, three, four—this represents a **whole tone** or **whole step**. As you can see, I'm achieving the same sound of the **F major scale** starting from the note **F**.

## Key Changes
Next, I encounter one flat, which is **B flat**. The subsequent key from **F** would be **B flat**. 

### Reasoning
Why is that? It’s because I'm moving a fourth up from **F**. One, two, three, four—that’s all there is to it; it’s that simple.

# Playing the Scale
From the note **B flat**, I’ll play it here for ease of understanding:

- **B flat**
- **C**
- **D**
- **E flat**

Counting one, two, three, four again, we see that the structure has changed; it’s now a flat, so I have both **B flat** and **E flat**.

### Complete Scale
Therefore, the full scale is:

- **B flat**
- **C**
- **D**
- **E flat**
- **F**
- **G**

# Music Theory: Key Transitions

In music theory, transitioning from the key of **F** to the next key, **B flat**, involves moving a **fourth up** from F. By counting one, two, three, four, I arrive at B flat. It's that straightforward.

## Notes in the Key of B Flat

Starting from the note **B flat**, the following notes can be played:

- B flat
- C
- D
- E flat
- F
- G
- A

This sequence returns to B flat, completing the scale. In the key of **B flat**, there are **two flats**: B flat and E flat.

## Differences from C Major

This transition highlights how we begin to diverge from **C major**. It is crucial to note that in the key of **C major**, there are **no accidentals**. In contrast, **F major** contains **one accidental**: B flat.

Consequently, the keys of **C major** and **F major** share a significant number of chords—almost all chords and notes, with the exception of one note: **B flat**.

This similarity facilitates an easy shift from the key of **C major** to **F major**.

# Key Signatures and Transitions

In the key of **B flat**, there are **two flats**. This marks the beginning of our shift away from the key of **C**.

## Key Comparisons

It's important to note the following differences among the keys:

- In the key of **C major**, there are **zero accidentals**.
- In **F major**, there is **one accidental**: **B flat**.

These two keys share many of the same chords and notes, with the exception of one note: **B flat**. This similarity allows for an easy transition from **C major** to **F major**.

### Common Transitions

The transition between **C major** and **F major** is quite common in music due to their close relationship. Similarly, when considering the transition between **C** and **G**, these two keys are also very close, enabling a seamless shift with just:

- One note
- One chord

This simplicity can provide a refreshing change in musical context.

## Exploring E Flat

Now, let's move to **E flat**. I will be playing the **E flat major scale** and exploring the possibilities it offers.

# Exploring Musical Keys

In music, shifting between keys is a common practice, especially when two keys are **very close** to each other. For instance, the transition between **C** and **G** is seamless; these two centers are **very close together**. It’s incredibly easy to shift with just one note or one chord, allowing for a refreshing change in musical direction.

## Key of E Flat

Now, let's focus on the **E flat** major scale and the flats associated with it. I’m stacking the flats as follows:

- **F** has one flat
- **B flat** has two flats
- **E flat** has three flats

In the key of E flat, we identify the following flats:

1. The first flat: **B flat**
2. The second flat: **E flat**
3. The third flat: **A flat**

This stacking technique applies consistently across all keys. We start with one flat and simply add another in the next key. This approach allows us to easily navigate to the **second** or **fourth** key in the sequence.

# Stacking Flats

I'm curious about the flats, so I'm stacking them. In the key of **E flat**, we have the following notes:

1. **First note:** B flat
2. **Second note:** E flat
3. **Third note:** A flat

This stacking pattern remains consistent across every key. Starting with the flat, we simply add one more in the next key.

# Moving to the Next Key

For the next key, the second or fourth note will be a fourth up. On the guitar, this motion is represented as **G flat equals F sharp**.

# A Flat Major

Now, let's pause here as we shift to **A flat major**. The notes in this scale are:

- A flat
- B flat
- C
- B flat
- B flat
- F
- G
- A flat

These notes form the A flat major scale, allowing you to hear the characteristic sound of the major scale starting from this note. To create the sound of the **C major scale** from A flat, I need to place these flats appropriately.

# A Flat Major Scale

We are going to discuss the **A flat major scale**. In A flat major, the notes are:

- A flat
- B flat
- C
- D flat
- E flat
- F
- G

You can hear the sound of the major scale starting from this note. In contrast, to create the sound of the **C major scale**, I need to adjust the flats accordingly.

In the context of A flat, the sequence of notes is:

- A flat
- B flat
- C
- D flat
- E flat
- F
- G

There are **four flats** in the key of A flat. The next key, **D flat**, will have **five flats**, which includes the four flats from A flat plus one additional flat. Starting from the note D flat, we can explore further into the scale.

# Understanding Musical Keys

To truly grasp musical keys, it's essential to utilize effective learning strategies. This can significantly enhance your understanding and retention of the material.

## Key Signatures

The key of **A flat** features four flats:

- **B flat**
- **E flat**
- **A flat**
- **D flat**

When moving to the next key, **D flat**, we encounter five flats. This includes the four flats from the key of A flat, plus an additional one.

## Color Changes in Music

Transitioning from the note **D flat**, we notice distinct color changes in music. On the guitar, these changes are particularly easy to visualize, allowing for clearer comprehension of the notes involved.

## Tips for Learning

As you delve into these concepts, it's beneficial to ask yourself questions. This self-inquiry will help ensure a solid understanding of the material.

# Understanding Guitar Notes

Playing the guitar makes it easy to visualize notes, as we can shift positions on the fretboard to see them clearly. As you practice, it's important to ask yourself whether you understand the concepts and can visualize the notes effectively.

## Degrees in Keys

Understanding the degrees within a key is also essential. For instance, when discussing the key of A flat, the notes correspond to the following degrees:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five
6. Six
7. Seven

Thus, the sequence of notes is: **one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one.**

# Understanding Keys and Degrees

In this section, we will explore the concept of musical keys and their corresponding degrees.

## Example: Key of A Flat

Let’s consider the key of A flat. The notes in this key are as follows:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
5. Five
6. Six
7. Seven

Thus, the sequence of notes can be summarized as: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one.

## Chords in the Key of A Flat

Next, let’s identify the chords in the key of A flat. This is where the *cycle of fourths* becomes particularly useful, as it helps us understand the relationships between these chord centers.

# Chords in the Key of A Flat

What are the chords in the key of A flat? This is where the *cycle of fourths* comes into play, as we begin to understand the relationship between these centers. Let's finish discussing the flats before we delve deeper into this concept.

## Chords in A Flat

- D flat
- G flat (equivalent to F sharp)

G flat contains six flats.

# Discussion on Flats

Let's finish discussing the flats, and then I'll explain a bit more about that. 

## Flats Overview

- We have **D flat**.
- The next one is **G flat**, which has six flats.

### G Flat and F Sharp

- Oftentimes, **G flat** is equivalent to **F sharp**. 
- This is a key transition point where we shift to the sharp side. 

You can see this in the diagram as well. Essentially, you can continue on if you want to.

# Shift to the Sharp Side

This section marks a pivotal moment as we transition to the **sharp side**. You can observe this shift in the accompanying diagram.

## Continuation Options

You have the option to continue on this path, but it primarily involves navigating through a lot of flats and sharps. While it is entirely feasible to proceed, we often opt to shift to the sharp side for **convenience reasons**.

### Example

- G flat would be...

# Music Theory Discussion

In music theory, we often encounter a lot of flats and sharps. While it's entirely possible to work within these parameters, for the sake of convenience, we frequently shift to other keys.

## Notes in G Flat

The notes in G flat are as follows:

- G flat 
- A flat 
- B flat 
- C flat 
- D flat 
- E flat 
- F 
- G flat 

Despite the numerous accidentals, we are still aiming to achieve the sound of **C major**.

## Cycle of Fourths

When I started working on the cycle of fourths...

# Musical Notes and Accidentals

In the context of **C major**, we have the following notes with accidentals: G flat, A flat, B flat, C flat, D flat, A flat, F, and G flat. While there are many accidentals present, they are essential for achieving the desired sound.

## Cycle of Fourths

When I began exploring the cycle of fourths and familiarizing myself with these two cycles, I focused on memorizing the names of the notes involved.

### List of Flats

The list of flats includes the following notes:

- C
- E
- A
- D
- G
- C
- F
- B flat
- E flat
- A flat
- D flat
- G flat
- C flat
- F flat

This collection of notes highlights the variety of flats used in the cycle of fourths.

# Understanding Musical Notes

I memorized the names of the notes by understanding two key cycles: flats and sharps.

## Flats

Let's start with the flats. The flat notes are:

- B flat
- E flat
- A flat
- D flat
- G flat
- C flat
- F flat

These are the flat notes.

## Sharps

In contrast, the sharps follow a different order. The sharp notes are:

- F sharp
- C sharp
- G sharp
- D sharp
- A sharp
- B sharp

This reverse order for sharps is quite interesting!

# Flats and Sharps

Let's start with the **flats**. It's interesting because their order is reversed when we move to the **sharps**.

## Sharps

The sharps are as follows:
- F sharp
- C sharp
- G sharp
- D sharp
- A sharp
- B sharp

When discussing the sharp side, we begin with the sound of **C major** and ascend a fifth.

### What is a fifth up?

In musical terms, a fifth up is represented by the notes: **Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, Do, Sol**.

# Understanding the Sharp Side

When discussing the sharp side, we start from **C major** and move a fifth up. 

## What is a Fifth Up?
In musical terms, going a fifth up corresponds to **Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, Do, Sol**. Therefore, **Sol** is equivalent to **G**.

## Building the G Major Scale
Now, let's build the **G major scale** starting from **G**. The notes in the **G major scale** are:

- Sol (G)
- La (A)
- Si (B)
- Do (C)
- Re (D)
- Mi (E)
- Fa (F#)
- Sol (G)

This sequence highlights the structure of the **G major scale** clearly.

# Building the C Major Scale from G

Let's start with **G**, which is a fifth up from **C**. Now, I will build the **C major scale** starting from **G**.

First, let's play the **G major scale**:

- Sol
- La
- Si
- Do
- Re
- Mi
- Fa
- Sol

The intervals for the **G major scale** are as follows:

- Whole step
- Whole step
- Half step
- Whole step
- Whole step
- Whole step
- Half step

Following this pattern, we arrive at **F sharp**. Great!

# Musical Steps

Ah, here it is. We have a sequence of **whole steps**, **whole steps**, **half steps**, **whole**, **whole**, **whole**, and **a half**. This leads us to **F sharp**. 

## Cycle of Fifths

From **G major**, the next key in the cycle of fifths is **D major**, which involves moving a **fourth up**. 

## Building Scales

Now, let's build the **C major scale** starting from the note **D**. Let's try it out.

# Key Changes in the Cycle of Fifths

In the cycle of fifths, starting from **G major**, the next key is **D major**, which is a fourth up.

## Building the D Major Scale

Let's construct the **D major scale**:

- Re
- Mi
- Fa#
- Sol
- La
- Si
- Do#
- Re

The **D major scale** contains two sharps: F# and C#.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, we continue the progression: one, two, three, four, five.

# D Major Scale

The **D major scale** consists of the notes: Re, Mi, Fa#, Sol, La, Si, Do#, Di, Re. This scale has **two sharps**.

# A Major Scale

Following the D major scale, the next scale is **A major**. It is constructed in the same manner as the cycle of fourths, but in reverse.

## Scale Construction

- C: zero sharps
- G: one sharp
- D: two sharps
- A: three sharps (notably, E is the sixth note)

This progression illustrates how each subsequent major scale adds one sharp, maintaining consistency in their construction.

# Chord Progression in D Major

In the key of **D Major**, the next chord is **A Major**. This progression follows a similar pattern to the cycle of fourths, but in reverse.

## Cycle of Fourths

Starting from **C**, the sequence of chords is as follows:

- **G**
- **D**
- **A Major**

Following **A Major**, we encounter **E**, which serves as the sixth chord in this context.

## Importance of Sound

Connecting to the sound is crucial for understanding these progressions. For example, in **C Major**, I can play a few chords to demonstrate how they resonate.

# Music Theory Insights

## Notes Sequence
Four, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do, Re, Mi, La, Do, Si, La, Sol, Fa, Mi.

## Importance of Sound Connection
It is essential to connect with the sound and make comparisons.

## Chords in Different Keys
In the key of C major, I can play several chords. However, transitioning to E major feels like entering a completely new universe.

## Understanding the Cycle of Fourths and Fifths
Understanding and controlling the cycle of fourths and fifths is crucial—it helps us know the location of notes and their proximity to one another.

# Understanding the Cycle of Fourths and Fifths

E major sounds like a *completely new universe*. This experience highlights the importance of understanding and mastering the cycle of fourths and fifths.

## Key Considerations

To navigate this cycle effectively, we need to be aware of the locations of the chords, distinguishing between what is *close* and what is *far*.

### Questions to Explore

- How can we achieve a better understanding of these relationships?
- How can we transition, perhaps using a diminished chord, to another location that is further away?

## Finding Connections

One effective strategy is to identify a *hinge chord*—a chord that exists in both keys. This connection can facilitate smoother transitions and enrich our musical exploration.

# Understanding Musical Shifts

What does it mean to be "far," and how can we reach that distance? How can we transition, perhaps with a slight diminishment, to another location that feels further away?

## Finding a Hinge Chord

To facilitate a smooth shift, we can identify a **hinge chord**—a chord that exists in both keys. 

While this may sound theoretical, it's essential to remember that this concept is rooted in actual music; it is about the sound itself.

**Understanding this is crucial.**

## Key Progression

Having explored **E major**, let's now transition to **B major**.

# Understanding Music Theory

To smoothly transition back, it's important to recognize that while we are discussing theory, **this is actually music; this is the sound**. Understanding this distinction is crucial.

## Moving to B Major

Now that we've covered E major, let's move on to **B major**. The notes in B major are:

- B
- C♯
- D♯
- E
- F♯
- G♯

In this context, I'm starting to encounter more **accidentals**. In total, there are **five accidentals** in the B major scale. If we were to introduce **F♯**, we would then have a total of **six accidentals**.

# Sound of C Major

The sound of C major consists of the following notes: Sol, di, es, la, di, and si. As I progress, I am encountering more accidentals.

## Accidentals

- The current key includes five accidentals.
- I will be stacking them again.
- Adding F sharp introduces a total of six accidentals.

## Chord Transition

When we refer to F sharp, we have the option to move to C sharp. However, within the context of the F sharp chord, we can also choose to shift back to G flat.

# Chord Transitioning

When discussing **F sharp**, we have the option to remain within the **F sharp** chord instead of transitioning directly to **C sharp**. From there, we can shift back to **G flat** and explore the flat side of the scale.

## Approach and Structure

This method allows us to incorporate **five or six accidentals** effectively, after which we can transition to the other side. Instead of stacking multiple accidentals—such as:

- Seven 
- Eight 
- Nine 
- Ten 

which can lead to a chaotic sound, we maintain a more manageable structure. This helps ensure a smoother musical flow.

# Transitioning Between Keys

Next, we return to the flat side. Here, we encounter **five or six accidentals**, but then we shift to the other side. Instead of stacking **seven, eight, nine, or ten accidentals**, which can become quite complicated, it's important to note that while it's possible, it’s **not super necessary**.

## Key Relationships

What is crucial for us to understand is the **relationship within the key**. We need to know how to transition from one key, specifically **C major**, to **F major**, and the notes involved in that process.

# Understanding Key Relationships

It's possible if you want it, but it's not super necessary. What is important for us to understand is the **relationship within the key**.

## Transition Between Keys

To smoothly transition from one key to another, such as from **C major** to **F major**, we need to identify the notes involved in that shift. This includes understanding:

- The sound of the major scale
- The incorporation of flats in the new key

## Memorization and Comprehension

While it's essential to memorize the cycle of keys, it's equally important to **understand** it. If you're struggling to grasp the concept, remember to **slow it down** for better clarity.

# Understanding the Major Scale

Understanding the sound of the **major scale** and how we incorporate **flats** is crucial for musicians.

## Memorization Tips

- It's essential to *memorize the cycle* of the major scale.
- If you're unsure, remember to *slow it down* for better clarity.

## Musical Experience

When playing this music, we can truly feel the **expansion and contraction** of these keys, which is a beautiful aspect of the major scale.

## Perception

To enhance your understanding, try to perceive the major scale as a location, similar to *geographical places*. This perspective can enrich your musical experience.

# Music and Emotion

When we listen to this music, we truly feel the *expansion and contraction* of the keys. It's a beautiful experience.

## Perception as Location

Consider perceiving music as a *location*, akin to geographical places or coordinates.

## Key Differences

It’s important to recognize that:

- C major evokes a certain emotional response 
- E major elicits a completely different feeling

The sound shifts dramatically between these keys.

# Understanding Musical Coordinates

Musical keys can be thought of like **coordinates** on a map. For instance, C major conveys a distinct feeling, while E major evokes an entirely different emotion. 

- The sound shifts
- Suddenly, I'm in a different place
- It's as if I've traveled afar
